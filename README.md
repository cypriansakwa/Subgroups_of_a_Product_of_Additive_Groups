Given two integers n and m, this Rust program computes the subgroups of $Z_n \times Z_m$.
The program follows these steps:
1. Compute all divisors of n and $m$.
2. Generate all subgroups of $Z_n$ and $Z_m$.
3. Form all possible Cartesian products of these subgroups to generate subgroups of $Z_n \times Z_m$.
